# Basic Express API

Your challenge is to build an Express API with INDEX, SHOW and CREATE routes, hooked up and persisting data to a Mongo DB database.

## Deliverables

You should submit a fully working API allows a user to create a resource and view all the resources stored in the database this.time using our real Mongo Database for the data. It should have the following working RESTful routes

1. INDEX
1. SHOW
1. CREATE

You can base your API around anything you like, but keep the resource simple for now.

## Bonus

Have a go at adding the remaining RESTful routes. You can do them in any order, but we would suggest the following:

1. DELETE
1. UPDATE

## Tips

* Dont forget to install dependencies with `npm i`
* Work slowly toward your goal, and test frequently as you go
* Do not copy / paste from code you have written during class, this will not help you understand how everything fits together
* Keep your model simple, you can always add more fields later if you want
* Add one route at a time and test in Insomnia before moving on
